# Understanding Python’s `list.remove` Method: A Natural Language Explainer

When you see `list.remove` in Python’s help system, you’re looking at a method that **removes** the first occurrence of a specific value from a list.

---

## What Is `remove` in Python for Lists?

- `remove` is an **instance method** of the `list` type.
- It **removes** the **first occurrence** of a specified value from the list.
- If the value is **not present**, it raises a `ValueError`.

---

## What You Write and What Python Does

- **What you write:**  
    `[1, 2, 3, 2].remove(2)`

- **What Python does:**  
    Searches the list from left to right for the first occurrence of the given value, and **removes it** (shifts the rest of the list left).  
    - Under the hood, Python runs:  
      `my_list.remove(value)`

---

## Parameters

- ``value``: The value you want to remove from the list (the **first occurrence** will be removed).

---

## What It Returns

- **Returns `None`.**
- The list itself is **modified in place** (mutated).
- If the value is not found, raises a `ValueError`.

---

## Examples

- **Remove a value:**  
      `lst = [1, 2, 3, 2]`  
      `lst.remove(2)`  
      `print(lst)`                    # [1, 3, 2]

- **Remove a value not present:**  
      `lst = [1, 3, 5]`  
      `lst.remove(2)`                 # ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list

- **Remove a value multiple times:**  
      `lst = [2, 2, 2]`  
      `lst.remove(2)`  
      `print(lst)`                    # [2, 2]  (only first occurrence removed)

---

## Quick Notes

- This method **mutates** the original list.
- Only the **first occurrence** is removed. If you want to remove all, use a loop or list comprehension.
- If the value is not in the list, you get a `ValueError`.

---

## In summary

- `list.remove(value)` finds and removes the first occurrence of `value` from the list.
- The original list is changed; the method returns `None`.
- Raises an error if the value is not found.
