# Understanding Python’s `str.__add__` Method: A Natural Language Explainer

When you see `str.__add__` in Python’s help system, you’re looking at the hidden “magic method” that allows strings to be added (concatenated) using the `+` operator.

---

## What Is `__add__` in Python?

- `__add__` is a **special (dunder) method** defined on many types, including strings.
- It tells Python **what to do when you use the `+` operator** between two objects.
- For strings, `__add__` means "concatenate" (combine end-to-end).

---

## What You Write and What Python Does

- **What you write:**  
    `"hello" + "world"`

- **What Python does:**  
    Calls the dunder method:  
    `"hello".__add__("world")`

- Both do **exactly the same thing**: create a new string with the contents of both, combined.

---

## Parameters

- ``self``: The first string (the one on the left of the `+`)
- ``value``: The string to add (the one on the right of the `+`)

---

## What It Returns

- A new string: the result of joining (concatenating) the left and right operands.

---

## Examples

- **Operator form:**  
      `"foo" + "bar"`                 # 'foobar'

- **Dunder method form:**  
      `"foo".__add__("bar")`          # 'foobar'

- **With variables:**  
      `a = "abc"; b = "def"; a + b`   # 'abcdef'  
      `a.__add__(b)`                  # 'abcdef'

- **If you add something that isn’t a string:**  
      `"foo".__add__(10)`             # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

---

## Quick Notes

- `__add__` is rarely called directly—you almost always use `+`.
- Understanding it helps you see how Python’s operator overloading works.
- You can define `__add__` in your own classes to make `+` work for your custom objects.

---

## In summary

- `str.__add__` is how Python strings implement the `+` operator.
- `"a" + "b"` is just a shortcut for `"a".__add__("b")`.
- If you want to use `+` with your own objects, define a `__add__` method in your class.

**Tip:**  
You can always see these special methods with:

    help(str.__add__)

Or, list all dunder methods on `str`:

    dir(str)
