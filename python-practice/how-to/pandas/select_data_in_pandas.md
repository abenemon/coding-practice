# Selecting Data in pandas DataFrames: Columns, Rows, loc, and iloc Explained

When working with pandas DataFrames, being able to select and subset your data is crucial for analysis. Here’s a clear explainer, based on your video transcript, about all the main ways to index, slice, and subset DataFrames using square brackets, `.loc`, and `.iloc`.

## Setting the Stage: Labeled DataFrames

- The DataFrame `brics` has both row and column labels.
- Proper labels make it easier to access columns, rows, and individual elements in your DataFrame.

## 1. Selecting Columns with Square Brackets

- To select a single column, use square brackets with the column name:
  
      brics['country']

  This returns a **pandas Series**, not a DataFrame.  
  You can check its type with:

      type(brics['country'])   # Returns: <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>

  A Series is like a labeled 1-dimensional array.

- To select a column **and keep it as a DataFrame**, use double square brackets:

      brics[['country']]

  Now, `type(brics[['country']])` returns a DataFrame.

- To select multiple columns as a DataFrame, pass a list of column names:

      brics[['country', 'capital']]

  This gives you a “sub-DataFrame” with just those columns.

## 2. Selecting Rows with Slicing

- You can select a range of rows using slicing (row indices):

      brics[1:4]

  This gets the second, third, and fourth rows. (Remember: the start is inclusive, the end is exclusive, and counting starts at 0.)

## 3. Square Brackets: Limitations

- Square brackets are simple, but don’t work like 2D NumPy arrays (where you can do `[row, column]`).
- For more flexible selection, pandas provides `.loc` and `.iloc`.

## 4. Selecting Data with `.loc`

- `.loc` lets you select data by **label** (row and/or column names).

- Select a row by label (returns a Series):

      brics.loc['RU']

- To keep it as a DataFrame, use double brackets:

      brics.loc[['RU']]

- Select multiple rows:

      brics.loc[['RU', 'IN', 'CH']]

- Select specific rows and columns (intersection):

      brics.loc[['RU', 'IN', 'CH'], ['country', 'capital']]

- Select **all rows** but just certain columns:

      brics.loc[:, ['country', 'capital']]

  (Here, `:` means "all rows".)

## 5. Selecting Data with `.iloc`

- `.iloc` is just like `.loc`, but uses **integer positions** (not labels).

- Get the second row (index 1):

      brics.iloc[1]

- Keep as DataFrame:

      brics.iloc[[1]]

- Multiple rows:

      brics.iloc[1:4]

- Rows and columns by index positions:

      brics.iloc[1:4, 0:2]    # Rows 1-3, columns 0-1

- All rows, first two columns:

      brics.iloc[:, 0:2]

## 6. Summary Table

| Task                                  | Square Brackets        | .loc (label-based)                | .iloc (position-based)        |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Single column (Series)                 | `brics['country']`     |                                   |                               |
| Single column (DataFrame)              | `brics[['country']]`   |                                   |                               |
| Multiple columns                       | `brics[['col1', 'col2']]` |                                 |                               |
| Row slice                             | `brics[1:4]`           |                                   |                               |
| Row by label                           |                        | `brics.loc['RU']`                 |                               |
| Row by position                        |                        |                                   | `brics.iloc[1]`               |
| Rows and columns (labels)              |                        | `brics.loc[['RU','IN'],['country']]` |                             |
| Rows and columns (positions)           |                        |                                   | `brics.iloc[1:3, 0:2]`        |

## 7. Final Tips

- Use single brackets for Series, double brackets for DataFrames.
- Use `.loc` for label-based selection and `.iloc` for position-based selection.
- Subsetting with `.loc` and `.iloc` feels like subsetting a 2D NumPy array, but with the power of labels.
- Practice these indexing methods to become comfortable with pandas DataFrames!
