# Understanding Python’s `abs()` Function: A Natural Language Explainer

When you see `abs(x)` in Python’s help system, you’re looking at the **absolute value** function.

---

## What Is `abs` in Python?

- `abs` stands for **absolute value**—it returns the non-negative value of its argument (removes any minus sign).
- Works on numbers: integers, floats, complex numbers (returns magnitude for complex).

---

## What You Write and What Python Does

- **What you write:**  
    `abs(x)`

- **What Python does:**  
    Calls the special method  
    `x.__abs__()`

---

## Parameters

- `x`: The number you want the absolute value of.  
  - Can be `int`, `float`, or `complex`.

---

## What It Returns

- If `x` is an `int` or `float`: returns the absolute value (always positive or zero).
- If `x` is `complex`: returns the magnitude (distance from 0).

---

## Examples

- `abs(5)`         # 5  
- `abs(-3)`        # 3  
- `abs(4.2)`       # 4.2  
- `abs(-7.9)`      # 7.9  
- `abs(3 + 4j)`    # 5.0 (since sqrt(3**2 + 4**2) == 5)

---

## Common Use Cases

- Remove negative signs from values.
- Compute distances (e.g., between two points on a number line).
- Find magnitude of a complex number.

---

## In summary

- `abs(x)` always returns a non-negative number, or the magnitude for complex numbers.
- It’s a built-in Python function—you can use it anytime without importing anything.

**Tip:**  
To see the official docs, run:
