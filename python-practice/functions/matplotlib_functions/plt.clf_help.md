# Understanding `plt.clf`: Clearing Figures in Matplotlib

The function `plt.clf()` is a quick way to **clear everything from the current figure window** in Matplotlib.

## What Does `plt.clf()` Do?

* `plt.clf()` stands for **clear figure**.
* When you call it, it removes all plots, labels, titles, and other elements from the current figure window, but keeps the window itself open and ready for new plots.
* It’s useful if you want to reuse the same figure for a new plot, instead of creating a new window.

## Basic Usage

``import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.show()
plt.clf()  # This clears the figure for new plots
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4])
plt.show()``

## When Should You Use It?

* Use `plt.clf()` when you want to erase all elements of a figure **without closing it**.
* If you want to start over with a fresh figure, but don’t want to open a new window, call `plt.clf()` before plotting again.

## Related Functions

* `plt.cla()` – Clears just the current axes (subplot), not the entire figure.
* `plt.close()` – Closes the figure window completely.

## In summary

* `plt.clf()` wipes the current figure clean, making it ready for new plots.
* It does not close the window—just empties it.
* Helpful for scripts or GUIs where you reuse the same figure window multiple times.
