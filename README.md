# Coding Practice

Welcome to my Coding Practice repository! 👋

This repo is a collection of my Python learning exercises, practice scripts, notes, and small projects.  
I'm using it to track my progress as I build my programming skills and learn tools like Git, GitHub, and Python libraries such as NumPy and pandas.

## 📂 What You'll Find Here

- Beginner to intermediate Python scripts (`.py` files)
- Notes on Python concepts and commands
- Example code for libraries like NumPy and pandas
- Solutions to practice problems
- Experimentation with new programming ideas

---

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

- To document my learning journey
- To practice version control and Git workflows
- To build a portfolio of code I can look back on and share
- To explore new topics and get better at Python!

## 🛠️ How I Work

- I write code using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (or another text editor)
- I track changes with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- I sync my work to [GitHub](https://github.com/) regularly
- I aim to commit frequently with clear messages

## 📚 Topics Covered (So Far)

- Python basics (`print`, variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- Working with lists, dictionaries, and files
- Using libraries like `numpy` and `pandas` for math and data analysis
- Automation scripts and small projects
- Experimenting with Jupyter notebooks (coming soon!)

---

## 🌱 Next Steps

- Learn more advanced Python features
- Try out Jupyter notebooks and data visualizations
- Keep practicing and sharing what I learn!
